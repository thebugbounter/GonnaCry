<h1> GonnaCry- Ransomware </h1>
Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or permanently block access to it unless a ransom is paid off. While some simple ransomware may lock the system without damaging any files, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion.

<h2> Working </h2>
To encrypt the contents of the "data.txt" file, we can utilize the "voldemort.py" script by executing it with the command `./voldemort.py`. Before running the script, we need to ensure that we have the necessary permissions by using the command `chmod +x voldemort.py`.

Upon execution of the script, the contents of "data.txt" will be encrypted. To decrypt the data, we can use the "decrypt.py" script by executing it with the command `./decrypt.py`. This will prompt us to provide a secret key, which is "Lucifer".
Once we have entered the secret key, the data will be successfully decrypted.
